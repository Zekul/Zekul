# Hi I am Luke Singh, 
## Data Scientist
My interests are in Data Mining, Statistical Modelling and Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning and Business Analyst. 
## About Me
I first Started programming in 2011, using C to make a windows calculator, since then I continued to program until 2013. 
From 2014, I started to study engineering in which my days of coding had stopped until 2018 when I started to program again.
Around 2019 I started to self teach myself python and found it much easier than other languages.
During this time I learnt HTML, CSS, and started to try game design by using Java.
Around 2020 I started to learn about data science and slowly started to dive deeper into python.
2021, I went to do a graduate diploma in data science.
Currently in 2022, My hobby is making models, workign with AI or visualization to tell stories.
### My Most my work can be found in Python-projects
